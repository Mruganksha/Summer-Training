//HTTP AND HTTPS
- http: protocol (due to this protocol all the transfer of data on internet takes place)

//HTTP METHODS EXPRESS:
GET – Retrieve data
POST – Send new data
PUT – Update existing data
DELETE – Remove data

--POST Request Basics
Used when a client wants to send data (usually from a form or JSON) to the server. For Express to read incoming data, you need middleware to parse the request body.

-Postman is a tool that helps you test APIs by simulating HTTP requests.
