//Data Storage:
-we can store data in .txt file but it is not efficient as imgs and all can't be stored so database 

//TYPES OF DBS: SQL | NoSQL
-SQL: data ko ek type mein rkhtay
-NoSQL : data is stored in form of objects (MongoDB follows NoSQL)

//what and why:
MongoDB is database

//terminologies - collections, documents, schemas, keys, modules

there are 2 servers :
application server            and               database server
    |                                                   | 
it handles the routes and requests              handles all the data
it does everything except for data
like login logout
if it requoires any kind of data 
it sends request to database,
accepts responses from database and
pass it to frontend


#DATABASE SERVER:

DataBase -> Collections -> Document

suppose there is a huge database which conatins many diff data projects like A, B, C, D, E and A projects contain again differents data in it , so all this datas in it are knows as collections
like suppose A have diff data of customers, users, shops so all this are collections.
now collection ke andhr there is documents

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
CODE                       DATABASE
mongoose.connect ->  database create
model create     ->  collection
CREATE           -> document

----------------------------------------------
-ORM (object-relational mapping) and ODM(object document mapping) are techniques used in software development to simplify database interactions
they act as a bridge between the application code and database

-ORMs are designed to work with relational databases (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
-ODMs are designed to work with document databases (NoSQL) like MongoDB.

CRUD   : create read update delete
CRUD stands for:
Create – Insert a new document into a MongoDB collection.
Read – Retrieve data/documents from the database.
Update – Modify existing data.
Delete – Remove documents from the collection.

//read: there r two ways  one reading whole or only single mentioned one
app.get('/read', async (req, res) => {

   res.send(users);
});  

//userModel.findOne({username: "annnd"}); //this will give only that specified
//find() always gives a array even if it is empty

//delete:
